            <h2>Quiz</h2>
            <p>This project began whilst I was still learning the basics of Javascript, HTML and CSS. The purpose was to enhance my skills further. I later proceeded to transform this project into a new REACT project to further enhance my skills across the front end. This quiz has since continued to grow and will continue to do so over time. However, the basic version of the quiz will remain in it's original form, leaving only the REACT version to be updated moving forward.</p>
