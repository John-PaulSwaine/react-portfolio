            <br />
            <h3>Why did I choose to enroll?</h3>
            <p>I enrolled onto the CodeNation Software Development Bootcamp to learn and develop coding skills whilst also getting to interview for job roles within the Software Development industry upon completion.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>What did the bootcamp cover?</h3>
            <p>The bootcamp covered both the front end and back end of development. This was done by focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, MongoDB, MySQL and REST APIs. The bootcamp culminated in a final project requiring the building of a full stack functional web application.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>What work was completed whilst on the bootcamp?</h3>
            <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <p>For the first week, we had to complete a navbar assignment utilising flexbox and creating a clone of an existing website. Coming to grips with flexbox did prove to be a challenge I had struggled with, however, this was worked on throughout the bootcamp and I have developed my skills with this.
                <br /><br />
                For the navbar assignment it was all about getting the page to be responsive with different screen sizes using the device toolbar with responsive dimensions.

                <br /><br />
                For my clone, I had chosen to use the Google Homepage as it required utilising flexbox more than some other sites may have done and this enabled me to not only develop my flexbox skills but also aided with learning how to import images, create navbars and searchbars.</p>
